Menus:  
Menus is an addon for Ashita that allows you to open your delivery box and the auction house anywhere in a zone that normally has those accessible. There is no safety check to look at your current zone and make sure it's one with those menus normally accessible.  

Commands:  
menus open ah - opens the auction house menu  
menus open db - opens your delivery box  
  
Warnings:  
You should only attempt to open these menus in zones that normally have access to them, such as towns, or Selbina/Mhaura for delivery box. Attempting to open one of these menus outside an area with them normally accessible may cause your client to be disconnected.

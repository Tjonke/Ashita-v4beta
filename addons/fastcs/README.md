# ffxi-addons/fastcs  
FastCS:
FastCS is an addon based on the Windower4 addon with the same name. It automatically uncaps your fps during cutscenes and other events. It includes the ability to exclude certain events from becoming uncapped based on the NPC name that starts the event. By default, Home Points, the Portal into Reisenjima/Sea, and the Einherjar Entry Gate are excluded.

Commands:
There are no commands. It works while it is loaded.

If there is an event where your fps doesn't get set back to default after the cutscene, you can use the fps addon commands to reset it, but it shouldn't often happen.
